Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark.
Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. 
The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular
students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, 
order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT s.name,
           g.grade,
           s.marks
    FROM students s
    JOIN grades g
      ON s.marks BETWEEN g.min_mark AND g.max_mark
)
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN grade < 8 THEN NULL
        ELSE name
    END AS name,
    grade,
    marks
FROM cte
ORDER BY
    grade DESC,
    CASE WHEN grade >= 8 THEN name END ASC,
    CASE WHEN grade < 8 THEN marks END ASC;

learning - two different sorting orders were needed, have used case inside order by
